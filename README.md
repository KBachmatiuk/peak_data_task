# peakdata interview task


## How to run the code

1. Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Place the data file in main folder
   (publications_min.csv needs to be located in the main folder)

3. Further steps of analysis
    I wrote a for loop which take a lot of time to process the whole list of authors.
    As a further step I would like to compare the specific author only to those which starts from the same letter as an example to narrow down the time needed to process the task.
    Similar logic can be applied to institutes.
